        <h1>What is execution context</h1>
        <P>the java script Engines creates the Special environment which handles the transformation <br>
            and execution of js code this environment is called execution context <br>
        ----->there are two kinds of execution context :-<br>
        1)global execution context<br>
        2)Functional execution context
     ----> GEC:- when ever a js engines encounter a js file it creates default execcution contrext<br>
      called global execution context which executes all the code except the code inside the function
    ----> FEC :- whenever a function is called js engine creates different FEC in GEC to executes code inside the functions  </P>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>what is creation phase and execution phase?</h1>
        <p>
           creation phase:- in this phase js engine create execution context and set up the script enbvironment 
                             variable are stored in the key value pair <br>
                             it determines the values of the variable and functions and setups the scope chain for context execution<br>
                             initially it stores all the variable  as undefined and function as defined <br>
           execution phase :- in this phase the js code start executing the code line by line it assign the <br>
            value to all the variable which is defined as undefined and the skips the funstion until its called 
           then when the function is called it creats FEC where the code inside the function is executed 
           after execution of the first funtion the function is removed from call stack and the second function 
           executed after all the functions are executed  the fec is removed from call stack and at the end GEC is also removed from call stack after execution 

                  
        </p>
        
        
    </div>
    <div><h1>what is an event loop and call stack</h1>
    <p>event loop :- Event loop: An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of <br>
        the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty
    call stack :- call stack is a queue of task which manages the order of execution context </p></div> 
    <div><h1>what is temporaldead zone(TDZ)</h1>
    <P>A let or const variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until code<br>
         execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized. While inside the TDZ, the <br>variable has
         not been initialized with a value, and any attempt to access it will result in a ReferenceError </P>
        <pre>
              if(true){
                console.log(a); //a is in temporal dead zone

                let a=12;
              }
        </pre> </div>
    <div> <h1>what is the spread operator</h1>
    <P> spread operator in js expands values in arrays and strings into individual element<br>
        rest operator puts the values which is user defined data into javascript array
    or spread operator ALLOW US to quickly copy all the parts of an existing array<br>
     and strings into another array or object</p>
        <pre>
            let a=[1,2,3,4]
            let b=[5,,7,8];
            let c=[...a, ...b]                                                                                                                  
            
        </pre></div>
        <div><h1>what is the use of setTimeout</h1>
        <p>setTimeout()method is used to set the timer which executes functions or specified piece of code once the timer expires  </p>
    <pre>
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("message delyaed for 1 sec")
        },1000);
    </pre></div>

    <div>
        <h1>what are callbacks?</h1>
        <p>callback is a function which is passed as an argument to another function and its executed in that function  </p>
    <pre>
       
function displayer(sum){
    console.log(sum);
}
function callbackFunc(n1,n2,callback){
    results=n1+n2;
    callback(results)
}
callbackFunc(2,3,displayer);
    </pre>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>
        what is call back hell?
    </h1>
    <p>callback hell is a phenomenon which occurs when we nest multiple callbacks with in a function</p>
    <pre>function firstfucn(alpha,time,callback){
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log(alpha);
            callback()
        },time)
    }
    function firstcallback(){
        firstfucn("a",1000,()=>{
            firstfucn("e",4000,()=>{
                firstfucn("i",3000,()=>{
    
                })
            })
        })
    }
    firstcallback()</pre>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>what is the difference between undefined ,notdefined and NaN</h1>
    <p>undefined: it is the value assigned to a variable when the varuable is initilized with the value<br>
    not defined:- indicated that variable does not exist<br>
     NAN:- NOt a number when ever a number is expected and found strinfn isted of that then it returns NAN</p>
     <pre>undefined:-
        console.log(a);
        var a;
        not defined:-
        console.log(b);
        NaN:-
        a="helo";
        b=4
        console.log(a/b);
